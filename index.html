            <h2>This Is Happening RIGHT NOW</h2>
            <p class="urgent">The Amity Board of Education is trying to fund AI-powered platforms including <strong>Class Companion</strong>, <strong>SchoolAI</strong>, and <strong>Magic School AI</strong>. They want YOUR tax dollars to pay companies that support ICE deportations and destroy the environment.</p>
            
            <p class="angry">These tools—powered by OpenAI's GPT-4—are being sold as "harmless learning tools." <strong>Don't be fooled.</strong> Any system that scores student work influences grades. And even if they didn't, the ethical violations alone should end this conversation.</p>

            <div class="alert">
                <strong>🚨 THE BUDGET VOTE IS COMING</strong>
                <p>The Board will vote soon. If you don't act NOW, this passes by default. Your silence = your approval.</p>

                    <h3>🏛️ Your School Is Funding ICE</h3>
                    <p><strong>OpenAI is a MAJOR ICE contractor.</strong> Their technology is actively used in deportation raids and surveillance of immigrant communities.</p>
                    <p class="callout">Amity pays OpenAI. Your tax dollars fund family separations. The district claims to oppose these policies while bankrolling the companies that enable them.</p>
                    <p>Direct complicity. No wiggle room.</p>

                    <p><strong>Projected 1,050 TWh by 2026</strong> = between Japan and Russia globally</p>
                    <p><strong>OpenAI servers: 20 million gallons of water DAILY</strong> just for cooling</p>
                    <p class="callout">Communities near data centers face water contamination and shortages. We teach kids about climate change, then burn fossil fuels to grade their essays.</p>

                    <p><strong>Students are already getting wrong grades from AI.</strong> Multiple reports of incorrect scoring that only got fixed when students pushed back.</p>

                    <h3>⚖️ Built on Stolen Content</h3>
                    <p><strong>OpenAI faces 70+ copyright lawsuits</strong> from authors, publishers, and content creators who never consented to their work being used.</p>
                    <p>Courts have found companies downloaded "pirated copies from shadow libraries" to train AI models. Anthropic recently settled for <strong>$1.5 billion</strong> over similar claims.</p>
                    <p class="callout">Amity is paying for tools built on mass copyright infringement, then using those tools to judge students on academic integrity.</p>

                    <h3>🎲 AI Replicates and Amplifies Bias</h3>
                    <p><strong>Research shows AI grading exhibits racial bias.</strong> A 2025 study found ChatGPT replicated demographic disparities in essay scoring—students from marginalized backgrounds got lower grades for the same quality work.</p>
                    <p>AI also struggles to distinguish great writing from mediocre work, giving out mostly Cs instead of recognizing excellence.</p>
                    <p class="callout">Strong writers lose recognition. Bias gets baked into grades. And unlike human teachers who can recognize and address their biases, AI just repeats patterns from flawed training data.</p>
