            <p class="urgent">The Board is trying to spend more money on AI grading platforms like <strong>Class Companion, SchoolAI, and Magic School AI.</strong> These are the tools that get your grades wrong, work with ICE, and burn energy like small countries.</p>
            
            <p class="angry">They're calling these "learning tools," not "grading tools." Don't fall for it. If it gives you a 1/3 or 2/3 or 3/3, <strong>that's grading.</strong> That score goes in PowerSchool and affects your transcript.</p>

            <h2>Why You Should Be Upset</h2>
            
            <div class="issue-grid">
                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>Amity Is Funding ICE</h3>
                    <p><strong>OpenAI is a MAJOR ICE contractor.</strong> Their technology is actively used in deportation raids and surveillance of immigrant communities.</p>
                    <p class="callout">Amity pays OpenAI. Your tax dollars fund family separations. The district claims to oppose these policies while paying the companies that enable them.</p>
                    <p>Amity is complicit in funding ICE deportations. As a No Place for Hate school, this is completely unacceptable.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>An Environmental Catastrophe</h3>
                    <p><strong>AI data centers used up 460 TWh in 2022</strong>, roughly equivalent to the entire nation of France</p>
                    <p><strong>Projected to consume 1,050 TWh by 2026</strong>, sitting between Japan and Russia globally</p>
                    <p><strong>OpenAI servers use 20 million gallons of water DAILY</strong> just for cooling. In 16 days, it'll use up enough water to fill Lake Chamberlain.</p>
                    <p class="callout">Communities near data centers face water contamination and shortages. We teach kids about climate change, then burn fossil fuels to grade their essays.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>Blatant Double Standards</h3>
                    <p><strong>Students using AI:</strong> Office referral, zero on assignment, phone call home.</p>
                    <p><strong>School using AI to grade students:</strong> Totally fine, budget allocations for it?</p>
                    <p class="callout">The handbook punishes kids for outsourcing their thinking to an LLM, yet Byars outsources judgment to the same tools.</p>
                    <p>The message here is that rules exist to control students and cut costs, not to uphold Amity's stewardship.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>The System DOESN'T WORK</h3>
                    <p><strong>Students are already getting wrong grades from AI.</strong> Since we've started this initiative, I've gotten multiple reports of incorrect scoring that only got fixed when students pushed back.</p>
                    <p class="callout">How many errors slipped through? How many students just accepted a wrong grade?</p>
                    <p>We're risking GPAs. College admissions. Scholarships. Futures. Using your tax dollars to fund it.</p>
                    <p><strong>The school is gambling with untested AI tools on your student's transcript.</strong></p>
                </div>

                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>Built on Stolen Content</h3>
                    <p><strong>OpenAI currently faces 70+ copyright lawsuits</strong> from authors, publishers, scientists, and content creators who never consented to their work being used.</p>
                    <p>Courts have found LLM companies downloaded "pirated copies from shadow libraries" to train AI models. Anthropic recently settled for <strong>$1.5 billion</strong> over similar claims.</p>
                    <p class="callout">Amity is paying for tools built on mass copyright infringement, then using those tools to judge students on academic integrity. Your schoolwork could be used to train the same models.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>AI Replicates and Amplifies Bias</h3>
                    <p><strong>Research shows AI grading exhibits racial biases.</strong> A 2025 study found ChatGPT replicated demographic disparities in essay scoring. Students from marginalized backgrounds got lower grades for the same quality work.</p>
                    <p>AI also struggles to distinguish great writing from mediocre work, giving out mostly Cs instead of recognizing excellence. A school capable of fostering multiple Scholastic writing awards winners will kill their writing programs with AI.</p>
                    <p class="callout">Strong writers will lose recognition, bias will get baked into grades, and unlike human teachers who can recognize and address their biases, AI just repeats patterns from its training data.</p>

I'm calling to urge Dr. Byars to reconsider the proposed funding for AI platforms like Class Companion, SchoolAI, and Magic School AI. These tools raise serious ethical concerns. OpenAI is a major ICE contractor, the environmental impact is staggering, and students are already receiving incorrect grades that require human correction. We should be investing in teachers and reducing class sizes, not funding experimental technology that gambles with student transcripts. I'm asking the administration to remove AI funding from the budget and reallocate those resources to programs that actually serve students. Thank you."
