            <h2>This Is Happening RIGHT NOW</h2>
            <p class="urgent">The Amity Board of Education is trying to increase funding for AI-powered platforms including <strong>Class Companion</strong>, <strong>SchoolAI</strong>, and <strong>Magic School AI</strong>. They want YOUR tax dollars to pay companies that gamble your student's transcript, support ICE deportations and destroy the environment.</p>
            
            <p class="angry">These tools, which are powered by OpenAI's GPT-4, are being sold as "harmless learning tools." <strong>Don't be fooled.</strong> Any system that scores student work influences grades. And even if they didn't, the ethical violations alone should end this conversation.</p>

            <div class="alert">
                <strong>🚨 THE BUDGET VOTE IS COMING 🚨</strong>
                <p>The Board will vote soon. If you don't act NOW, this passes by default. Your silence is your approval.</p>

                    <h3>Your School Is Funding ICE</h3>
                    <p><strong>OpenAI is a MAJOR ICE contractor.</strong> Their technology is actively used in deportation raids and surveillance of immigrant communities.</p>
                    <p class="callout">Amity pays OpenAI. Your tax dollars fund family separations. The district claims to oppose these policies while bankrolling the companies that enable them.</p>
                    <p>Direct complicity. No wiggle room.</p>

                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>Environmental Destruction at Scale</h3>
                    <p><strong>AI data centers consumed 460 TWh in 2022</strong> , equivalent to the entire nation of France</p>
                    <p><strong>Projected 1,050 TWh by 2026</strong>, sitting between Japan and Russia globally</p>
                    <p><strong>OpenAI servers: 20 million gallons of water DAILY</strong> just for cooling. In 16 days, it'll use up enough water to fill Lake Chamberlain.</p>
                    <p class="callout">Communities near data centers face water contamination and shortages. We teach kids about climate change, then burn fossil fuels to grade their essays.</p>

                    <h3>Blatant Double Standards</h3>
                    <p><strong>Students using AI:</strong> Office referral, zero on assignment, phone call home.</p>
                    <p><strong>School using AI to grade students:</strong> Totally fine?</p>
                    <p class="callout">You punish kids for outsourcing thinking, then outsource judgment to the same tools.</p>
                    <p>The message here is that rules exist to control students, not to uphold principles.</p>

                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>The System DOESN'T WORK</h3>
                    <p><strong>Students are already getting wrong grades from AI.</strong> Multiple reports of incorrect scoring that only got fixed when students pushed back.</p>
                    <p class="callout">How many errors slipped through? How many students just accepted a wrong grade?</p>
                    <p>GPAs. College admissions. Scholarships. Futures.</p>
                    <p><strong>The school is gambling with untested AI tools on your student's transcript.</strong></p>

                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>Built on Stolen Content</h3>
                    <p><strong>OpenAI faces 70+ copyright lawsuits</strong> from authors, publishers, and content creators who never consented to their work being used.</p>
                    <p>Courts have found companies downloaded "pirated copies from shadow libraries" to train AI models. Anthropic recently settled for <strong>$1.5 billion</strong> over similar claims.</p>
                    <p class="callout">Amity is paying for tools built on mass copyright infringement, then using those tools to judge students on academic integrity.</p>

                <div class="issue-card">
                    <h3>AI Replicates and Amplifies Bias</h3>
                    <p><strong>Research shows AI grading exhibits racial bias.</strong> A 2025 study found ChatGPT replicated demographic disparities in essay scoring—students from marginalized backgrounds got lower grades for the same quality work.</p>
                    <p>AI also struggles to distinguish great writing from mediocre work, giving out mostly Cs instead of recognizing excellence.</p>
                    <p class="callout">Strong writers will lose recognition. Bias will get baked into grades. And unlike human teachers who can recognize and address their biases, AI just repeats patterns from flawed training data.</p>

These tools raise serious ethical concerns—OpenAI is a major ICE contractor, the environmental impact is staggering, and students are already receiving incorrect grades that require human correction. We should be investing in teachers and reducing class sizes, not funding experimental technology that gambles with student transcripts. I'm asking the administration to remove AI funding from the budget and reallocate those resources to programs that actually serve students. Thank you."
